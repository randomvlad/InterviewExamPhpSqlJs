# Interview Take Home Exam for PHP, MySQL and Javascript

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ...

... I was tasked with hiring an entry/mid-level LAMP developer to work on my team. I cooked up a take home exam, that all candidates would receive very early in the interview process to establish basic competence.

Exam consists of three relatively straight forward problems testing PHP, MySQL and Javascript. If you are curious and would like to take a stab, look no further and download "InterviewSoftwareDevProblems.zip" and go from there. Otherwise browse them here (my solutions are provided).
